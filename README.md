Exercise solutions for The C Programming Language, 2nd edition

You will find sometimes a file named lorem_ipsum.txt (or similar) that you can use for testing.

For example, if `a.out` is the executable then you could do something like `./a.out < lorem_ipsum.txt`.

## Exercise 4-5, 4-6, 4-10 and 4-11
This program uses the math library functions `sin`, `exp` and `pow`; make sure you link with the math library, e.g. `gcc calculator.c -lm`.

## Exercise 5-7
You can test the program like this `./a.out < lines.txt`. `lines.txt` is a long computer science poetry.
You can it like so `time ./a.out < lines.txt`.

## Exercise 5-11 and 5-12
Similar to 5-7, but you'll find two files; one for testing `detab` and one for `entab`.

## Exercise 5-13
Similar to 5-7.
