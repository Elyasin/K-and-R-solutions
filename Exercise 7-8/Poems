Basic Principles

Coupling, Cohesion
Antagonistic forces
Tradeoffs to be made.

Chaining

Solvers in a chain
Requests passed one to the next
Only one reacts.

The Stand-in

Looks like the real thing
But really hides it from view
Protect, remote, smart.

Sharing

Actions are the same 
Processes come together
Continue apart.

Timed Systems

Time passes freely
Ticks never inconsistent
The system runs true.

Real-Time Systems

Time is essential
On time, not late, not early
Fail predictably.

Object Behavior

States and transitions
Statechart defines behavior
Or hide it in code.

A Watchdog

Waiting for the strokes
Stroke, something is working, stroke
No stroke comes, woof, woof.
