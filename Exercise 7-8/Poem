By Steve Jackson,
with apologies to Robert Frost.

Whose code this is I think I know
he’s on a different project, though
he will not see me working here
to simplify the data flow

My oldest friends would think it queer
that I allow my own career
to keep me till such hours awake
so many evenings of the year

I save my changes, then run make
and give my wrists a little shake
The only other sound’s the beep
that says I’ve made a small mistake.

Bed would be lovely, soft and deep,
but I’ve a deadline I must keep
and much to write before I sleep,
and much to write before I sleep.
